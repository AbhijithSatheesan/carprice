nterview Simulation: Python Django Role with ML Integration
Phase 1: Introduction
Interviewer: Good morning/afternoon! Let’s start with your introduction. Could you briefly tell me about yourself, your educational background, and your experience with Python, Django, and Machine Learning?

Phase 2: Django Questions
1. Django Basics

What is Django, and why did you choose it for web development?
How does Django's MTV (Model-Template-View) architecture work?
Explain how Django handles database queries.
What are Django's settings files used for? How do you handle different environments (e.g., development and production)?
2. Models and Migrations

What are models in Django, and how do you define them?
How do migrations work in Django? What command would you use to apply all pending migrations?
How would you add a new field to an existing model without losing data?
3. Views and Templates

Explain the difference between function-based views (FBVs) and class-based views (CBVs). Which do you prefer, and why?
How would you pass data from a view to a template?
How do you handle forms in Django?
4. Authentication and Authorization

How does Django handle user authentication?
How would you implement a feature where users can only access their data and not others'?
5. REST Framework

Have you worked with Django REST Framework (DRF)? Can you explain how you would create a RESTful API for an e-commerce app?
What are serializers in DRF, and why are they used?
6. Deployment

How do you deploy a Django project?
What are WSGI and ASGI? How are they relevant to Django?
What tools would you use to monitor a deployed Django application?
Phase 3: Python Questions
1. Python Basics

Explain the difference between a list and a tuple in Python.
What are Python's mutable and immutable data types?
How does Python's garbage collection work?
2. Intermediate Python

What is a decorator in Python? Can you give an example of where you might use one?
How would you handle exceptions in Python?
Explain the use of @staticmethod and @classmethod.
3. Advanced Python

How does Python's GIL (Global Interpreter Lock) affect multi-threading?
What are Python generators, and how do they differ from iterators?
How would you optimize a slow Python application?
Phase 4: Logical and Problem-Solving Questions
1. Basic Logic

Write a Python function to reverse a string.
How would you find the most frequent element in a list?
2. Intermediate Logic

Write a function to check if a string is a palindrome.
How would you implement a basic stack or queue using Python lists?
3. Complex Logic

Given a list of numbers, find the pair that adds up to a specific target sum. Optimize for performance.
Write a function to traverse a binary tree in-order.
Phase 5: Machine Learning Integration with Django
1. Machine Learning Basics

What machine learning algorithms have you worked with? Can you explain one in detail?
How do you evaluate the performance of a machine learning model?
2. Integration with Django

How would you integrate a pre-trained ML model into a Django project?
What is the role of APIs in serving ML predictions through a Django application?
How would you handle scalability when your ML model needs to serve predictions for thousands of requests per minute?
3. Real-World Scenario

Suppose you have an ML model predicting house prices. How would you design an end-to-end Django application to allow users to input data and receive predictions?
How would you log and monitor the predictions for accuracy and anomalies?
Phase 6: Closing
Interviewer:

Is there anything specific you would like to ask or discuss about this role?
Are there any projects you’re particularly proud of that you’d like to share?
This structure balances technical, logical, and real-world application-focused questions. Would you like guidance on answering any specific questions or topics?
